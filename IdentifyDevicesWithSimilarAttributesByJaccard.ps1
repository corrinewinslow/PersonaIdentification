CoPilot: give me a PowerShell algorithm for finding a list of devices with similar attributes based on a jaccard index

PowerShell script for finding a list of devices with similar attributes based on the Jaccard Index. This script calculates the similarity between each pair of devices and groups them if the Jaccard Index meets or exceeds a specified threshold.

How It Works:
Input Devices: Devices and their attributes are stored in a $devices hashtable.

Jaccard Index Calculation:

Intersection: Shared attributes between two devices.

Union: All unique attributes of the two devices.

Formula: Jaccard Index = (Size of Intersection) / (Size of Union)

Threshold Setting: The $jaccardThreshold defines the minimum similarity required for devices to be grouped together.

Group Devices: Devices with a Jaccard Index above the threshold are grouped in $similarDeviceGroups.

Output Results: Similar device groups are displayed, listing the devices and their corresponding Jaccard Index.

Example:
For the following devices:

Device1 = WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS
Device2 = Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS
Device3 = WiFi, Bluetooth
Device4 = GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC
With a threshold of 0.5, the output might look like:

Groups of devices with similar attributes based on Jaccard Index:
Device1: Device2, Device3, Device4
Device2: Device4
Device3: Device4

# Define a hashtable of devices and their attributes
$devices = @{
    "Device1" = @("WiFi", "Bluetooth", "GPS")
    "Device2" = @("Bluetooth", "WiFi", "GPS")
    "Device3" = @("WiFi", "Bluetooth")
    "Device4" = @("GPS", "WiFi", "Bluetooth", "NFC")
}

# Define the Jaccard Index threshold (e.g., 0.5 means 50% similarity)
$jaccardThreshold = 0.5

# Create an empty hashtable to group devices based on similarity
$similarDeviceGroups = @{}

# Compare each pair of devices
$deviceKeys = $devices.Keys
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $deviceKeys.Count; $i++) {
    for ($j = $i + 1; $j -lt $deviceKeys.Count; $j++) {
        $deviceA = $deviceKeys[$i]
        $deviceB = $deviceKeys[$j]

        # Get the sets of attributes for both devices
        $attributesA = $devices[$deviceA]
        $attributesB = $devices[$deviceB]

        # Calculate intersection and union of the two sets
        $intersection = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $attributesA -DifferenceObject $attributesB -IncludeEqual |
                        Where-Object { $_.SideIndicator -eq "==" } |
                        Select-Object -ExpandProperty InputObject

        $union = $attributesA + $attributesB | Sort-Object -Unique

        # Calculate Jaccard Index
        $jaccardIndex = $intersection.Count / $union.Count

        # Check if the Jaccard Index meets or exceeds the threshold
        if ($jaccardIndex -ge $jaccardThreshold) {
            # Group devices based on similarity
            if ($similarDeviceGroups.ContainsKey("$deviceA")) {
                $similarDeviceGroups["$deviceA"] += "$deviceB"
            } else {
                $similarDeviceGroups["$deviceA"] = @("$deviceB")
            }
        }
    }
}

# Display the groups of similar devices
Write-Host "Groups of devices with similar attributes based on Jaccard Index:" -ForegroundColor Green
foreach ($group in $similarDeviceGroups.GetEnumerator()) {
    Write-Host "$($group.Key): $($group.Value -join ', ')"
}
