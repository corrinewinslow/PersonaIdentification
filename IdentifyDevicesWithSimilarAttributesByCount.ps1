CoPilot: give me a PowerShell algorithm for finding a list of devices with similar attributes based on a count-based index

PowerShell script that outputs a list of devices grouped by their similarity, using a count-based index as the metric. The script identifies groups of devices that share a sufficient number of attributes based on a defined threshold.

How It Works:
Input Devices: Each device is stored in the $devices hashtable, with its attributes represented as arrays.

Threshold Setting: The $threshold specifies the minimum number of shared attributes required for devices to be considered similar.

Pairwise Comparison: A nested loop compares all pairs of devices.

Intersection Calculation: The Compare-Object cmdlet finds shared attributes between devices.

Group Devices: Devices with shared attributes meeting the threshold are added to the $similarDeviceGroups hashtable.

Output Results: The script outputs a list of devices grouped by their similarity.

Example Output:
For the following devices:

Device1 = WiFi, Bluetooth, GPS
Device2 = Bluetooth, WiFi, GPS
Device3 = WiFi, Bluetooth
Device4 = GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, NFC
With a threshold of 2, the output might look like:

Groups of devices with similar attributes based on count-based index:
Device1: Device2, Device3, Device4
Device2: Device4
Device3: Device4

# Define a hashtable of devices and their attributes
$devices = @{
    "Device1" = @("WiFi", "Bluetooth", "GPS")
    "Device2" = @("Bluetooth", "WiFi", "GPS")
    "Device3" = @("WiFi", "Bluetooth")
    "Device4" = @("GPS", "WiFi", "Bluetooth", "NFC")
}

# Define the count-based similarity threshold (minimum number of shared attributes)
$threshold = 2

# Create an empty hashtable to group devices by their similarity
$similarDeviceGroups = @{}

# Compare each pair of devices
$deviceKeys = $devices.Keys
for ($i = 0; $i -lt $deviceKeys.Count; $i++) {
    for ($j = $i + 1; $j -lt $deviceKeys.Count; $j++) {
        $deviceA = $deviceKeys[$i]
        $deviceB = $deviceKeys[$j]

        # Get the sets of attributes for both devices
        $attributesA = $devices[$deviceA]
        $attributesB = $devices[$deviceB]

        # Calculate the intersection of the two sets (shared attributes)
        $sharedAttributes = Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $attributesA -DifferenceObject $attributesB -IncludeEqual |
                            Where-Object { $_.SideIndicator -eq "==" } |
                            Select-Object -ExpandProperty InputObject

        # Check if the count of shared attributes meets the threshold
        if ($sharedAttributes.Count -ge $threshold) {
            # Group devices that share enough attributes
            if ($similarDeviceGroups.ContainsKey("$deviceA")) {
                $similarDeviceGroups["$deviceA"] += "$deviceB"
            } else {
                $similarDeviceGroups["$deviceA"] = @("$deviceB")
            }
        }
    }
}

# Display the groups of similar devices
Write-Host "Groups of devices with similar attributes based on count-based index:" -ForegroundColor Green
foreach ($group in $similarDeviceGroups.GetEnumerator()) {
    Write-Host "$($group.Key): $($group.Value -join ', ')"
}
