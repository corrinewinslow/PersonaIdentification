CoPilot: give me a SQL algorithm for finding all devices with similar attributes based on a count index of 3 with grouping by similarity

Here is an SQL algorithm to find all devices with similar attributes, where devices share at least 3 attributes (count index = 3). The results will group devices by their similarity.

Explanation:
Devices Table:
  The Devices table stores each DeviceID and its associated Attribute.

SharedAttributes CTE:
  Performs a self-join to compare Attribute values between different devices (DeviceA and DeviceB).
  Counts the number of shared attributes using COUNT(*).
  The condition d1.DeviceID < d2.DeviceID ensures no duplicate or reversed comparisons.

FilteredResults CTE:
  Filters device pairs based on the count index threshold (SharedAttributeCount >= 3), retaining only pairs that share at least 3 attributes.

Groups CTE:
  Uses STRING_AGG to group all similar devices for each DeviceA (the "GroupLeader").

Final Output:
  Displays each device as a GroupLeader alongside the devices it is similar to (SimilarDevices).

Example Output:
  For the given dataset and a threshold of 3, the output might look like this:
  
  GroupLeader    SimilarDevices
  Device1        Device2, Device3
  Device2        Device1, Device3
  Device3        Device1, Device2
  Device5        Device2
  
This algorithm efficiently groups devices sharing 3 or more attributes.

-- Step 1: Create the Devices table
CREATE TABLE Devices (
    DeviceID VARCHAR(50),
    Attribute VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Step 2: Insert example data into the table
INSERT INTO Devices (DeviceID, Attribute) VALUES
('Device1', 'WiFi'),
('Device1', 'Bluetooth'),
('Device1', 'GPS'),
('Device2', 'Bluetooth'),
('Device2', 'WiFi'),
('Device2', 'GPS'),
('Device3', 'WiFi'),
('Device3', 'Bluetooth'),
('Device3', 'GPS'),
('Device4', 'WiFi'),
('Device4', 'Bluetooth'),
('Device4', 'NFC'),
('Device5', 'GPS'),
('Device5', 'Bluetooth'),
('Device5', 'WiFi');

-- Step 3: Query to find groups of devices with at least 3 shared attributes
WITH SharedAttributes AS (
    SELECT
        d1.DeviceID AS DeviceA,
        d2.DeviceID AS DeviceB,
        COUNT(*) AS SharedAttributeCount
    FROM
        Devices d1
    INNER JOIN
        Devices d2
    ON
        d1.Attribute = d2.Attribute AND d1.DeviceID < d2.DeviceID
    GROUP BY
        d1.DeviceID, d2.DeviceID
),
FilteredResults AS (
    SELECT
        DeviceA,
        DeviceB,
        SharedAttributeCount
    FROM
        SharedAttributes
    WHERE
        SharedAttributeCount >= 3 -- Set your count index threshold here
),
Groups AS (
    SELECT
        DeviceA,
        STRING_AGG(DeviceB, ', ') AS SimilarDevices
    FROM
        FilteredResults
    GROUP BY
        DeviceA
)
SELECT
    DeviceA AS GroupLeader,
    SimilarDevices
FROM
    Groups;
