CoPilot: give me a SQL algorithm for finding all devices with similar attributes based on a count index of 3 with grouping by similarity and all devices are only added once

Here is a SQL algorithm to find all devices with similar attributes, ensuring that each device is included only once in the final groups. The count index threshold is set to 3 shared attributes, and the devices are grouped distinctly by similarity.

Explanation:
  1. Devices Table: Stores DeviceID and its associated attributes.
  2. SharedAttributes CTE:
    - Performs a self-join to calculate the number of shared attributes between pairs of devices.
    - Ensures distinct pair comparisons (d1.DeviceID < d2.DeviceID) to avoid duplicates.
  3. FilteredResults CTE: Filters the pairs that have at least 3 shared attributes using the threshold condition (SharedAttributeCount >= 3).
  4. DistinctGroups CTE: Groups devices into similarity clusters using STRING_AGG, where each DeviceA becomes the leader of a group containing all DeviceB devices.
  5. Final Query: Ensures that each device is listed only once by excluding any device already listed as DeviceB in a prior group (DeviceA NOT IN (SELECT DeviceB FROM DistinctGroups)).

Example Output:
  For the given dataset and a count index threshold of 3, the output might look like this:

  GroupLeader    SimilarDevices
  Device1        Device2, Device3
  Device4        Device5

This algorithm ensures that all devices are grouped uniquely and no device appears in more than one group.

-- Step 2: Insert example data into the table
